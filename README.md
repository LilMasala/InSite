# InSite

InSite is an iOS application built with SwiftUI that integrates HealthKit and Firebase services. The project collects various health metrics from an iPhone or Apple Watch and allows users to manage diabetes therapy settings and infusion site changes. Authentication supports email/password, Google, Apple, and anonymous sign in.

## Features

- **HealthKit integration** – retrieves blood glucose, heart rate, exercise data, sleep durations, body mass, resting heart rate, energy burned, and menstrual information via `HealthStore` and `DataManager` classes.
- **Firebase integration** – handles user authentication with multiple providers (`AuthManager`) and stores user profiles in Firestore (`UserManager`).
- **Site change tracking** – `SiteChangeUI` and `SiteChangeData` manage insulin infusion site locations and days since the last change.
- **Therapy settings** – `TherapySettings` lets users create profiles containing hour‑based carb ratios, basal rates, and insulin sensitivity values which are persisted via `ProfileDataStore`.
- **Profile and settings views** – `ProfileView` loads the current user's information while `SettingsView` enables password resets, email updates, and logout.
- **Home screen** – `HomeScreen` provides navigation links to account settings, therapy settings, data synchronization, and site change management.

## Directory Overview

- `InSite/` – Source files for the app including Core views, authentication helpers, Firestore interaction, utilities, and health data models.
- `InSite/InSiteUI/` – Main SwiftUI views such as `InSiteApp.swift`, `HomeScreen.swift`, `SiteChangeUI.swift`, and `TherapySettings.swift`.
- `InSite/InSiteData/` – Health data managers and types used to fetch and process HealthKit information.
- `InSite/Auth/` – Firebase authentication manager and Google sign‑in helper.
- `InSite/Firestore/` – Firestore models and user persistence logic.
- `InSiteTests/` and `InSiteUITests/` – Unit and UI test stubs generated by Xcode.

## Building

Open `InSite.xcodeproj` in Xcode (version 15 or newer). The project requires Firebase configuration and HealthKit capabilities enabled in your Apple developer account. Build and run on a device with HealthKit support.
